CS3810 Mini-Project 1 - Part 1: The Environment (30 points)
============================================================

Implement the VacuumWorld class below. Do not change any method name or
signature: run_tests.py and the grading harness call them exactly as written.

Reminders from the handout (Section 1.2):

  * A state is ((row, col), frozenset_of_dirty_cells). It must be HASHABLE,
    because your searches will put states into sets and dictionaries. Use a
    tuple for the position and a frozenset for the dirt - a plain set will
    raise TypeError the first time you add it to your explored set.

  * result() must NOT mutate the state it is given. Build and return a new
    one. This is the single most common bug in this project: if you mutate,
    every state sitting in your frontier silently becomes the same state.

  * get_actions() must return actions in the canonical order below, filtered
    down to the legal ones. Illegal actions are never generated: no CLEAN in
    a clean cell, no move into a wall or an obstacle. Determinism here is
    what makes your node counts comparable with everyone else's.
